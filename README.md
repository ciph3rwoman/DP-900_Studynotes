To pass the MSFT DP-900 exam, you will need resources that will help you in clearing the exam. There are a lot of resources online and it depends on what kind of learner you are. The recommended pathway for MSFT is through the MSFT Learn portal which has mainly documentation. If you are visual learner, this may not be the best resource for you. 

Here are a list of resources that helped me prepare for the exam:
